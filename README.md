[WEBTOON](https://www.webtoons.com/en/) is a popular platform for creators and storytellers to publish their original content for the world to see, for free! The website is home to thousands of creator-owned content with amazing, diverse visions from all over the world.
In particular, I have chosen to analyze one of my favorite series available on WEBTOON, [My Giant Nerd Boyfriend](https://www.webtoons.com/en/slice-of-life/my-giant-nerd-boyfriend/list?title_no=958), the artist of which goes by the name "fishball". In this project, I'll be performing a sentiment anaylsis on fishball's very first episode, based on all the comments posted by users who have read it.
